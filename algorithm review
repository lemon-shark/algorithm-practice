1. The Topics covered will be:
 - Basics of C++ (What you need for Competitive Programming)
 - Linear Data Structures 
    - 2 Problems, solved live in front of you
 - Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, Coin Change and Rod Cutting)
    - 1-2 Problems, solved live in front of you
 - Graph Basic: Breadth First Search, Depth First Search and Colouring Components
    - 1-2 Problems, solved live in front of you
 
 2. Participants will take part in a weekly reading group that discusses the mother of all textbooks: Competitive Programming 3.
 
 3. BFS, DFS and Connected Components
 
 4. We will be covering primarily string processing; demystifying all its so called complicated data structures, and breaking down their finicky algorithms.
 
 5. As the academic year approaches, we decided to wrap up our reading sessions with more involved graph topics. These include Shortest Paths (along with all its variants), Minimum Spanning Trees, and Network Flow.
